# AWS-Polly-Narrator
The Blog/Book Narrator project leverages AWS services to convert text files (such as blog posts, articles, newsletters, or book excerpts) into speech. This is particularly useful for creating audio versions of written content, making it accessible to a wider audience, including those who prefer listening over reading.
